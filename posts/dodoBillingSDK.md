## **using dodo’s adapter to handle payments in your ai saas**

when you’re building an **ai powered saas**, you dream about **users scaling up**. not about the **infrastructure headaches** that come with them. the last thing on your mind? **integrating payments**, especially if you want to **serve users everywhere**. *for most **indie founders and engineers**,* managing payments feels like ***wrestling with APIs***, keeping up with **local payment** methods, and stressing about *compliance* or ***failed transactions***.

but you’re writing code to solve **real problems**, should collecting money for your hard work really be this **complicated?** that’s where **dodo’s adapter changes the game**. instead of spending weeks piecing together payment flows, hunting for **tax** libraries, or coding yet another **subscription handler**, you can drop in **dodo’s adapter** and focus on what your app does best.

dodo’s **pre built adapters** (node, python, next.js take your pick) let you implement your first **global checkout** or **subscription in minutes,** not weeks. just install, configure your keys, and connect. better yet, dodo abstracts away the gnarly details, supporting **25+ global and local payment** options so you don’t lose users to “*unsupported payment*” errors.

even if your ai app tracks variable usage, think number of API calls, storage, or events. the **dodo billingsdk** can meter and **bill automatically**, all while managing **tax** and **compliance** behind the scenes. that means you grow from **prototype to production** without hitting a wall, trusting that **payments** and **legal** are just... handled.

*startups are about momentum. don’t let money be yet another blocker. let dodo handle the boring part, so your code can change the world.*
